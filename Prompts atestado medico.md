Old one here, so sorry!! Ill send the new super power one soon ;-p)
I love AI and been looking to embrace something I believe in for real. 50 year old Sr Creative Director and Business Consultant - but these are just cute names...what I love is to PUSH companies I believe in with my heart and experience. 5M+ on Upwork, my goal is to help everybody I can (personal mission) - AI is something Ive been studying deeply for a long time now... I have a very good grip on it already - and when I say that... is because I really do. No time to waste. Just to clarify, I think strategy, brand positioning, concept, and all the conceptual part....and then I can design literally everything - branding, UI/UX (for 27 years in a row..), and everything else. I worked on Brazil's biggest TV Network for 8 years as Sr Creative Director Digital for the whole company, so I know a lot about animations, videos, etc - but this is the only thing I dont produce myself (once its on your requests). But believe me...if you work with mae, that will be completely irrelevant. And Im just saying that because I know exactly who I am, and what I can offer you guys. On a daily basis Im that weirdo that dont do to conventions, TEDs etc etc no matter how many times I am invited. I dont give away my "chi". I strategically organize where I'll use it (till regenaration) - but call ne crazy --- some sort of intuition brought me to this little text input field...and I follow my instincts. Anyway, thank you so much for the opportunity! And no ties - I would love to schedule a call with you guys to give you my consultancy work for free. Again, intuition. Thanks!!!!



im going to create a website focused on feeding professional betters on soccer in the US on websites live bet365 and all others soccer hetting related. 

everybody seems to oversee - or not care - that these guys arenÂ´t only about numbers (and of course I understand, many other are about numbers). But soccer is a mixture.... if john has hurt his knee (that impact numbers because the is the best center field)....if the technician paul left the team (gosh this changes everything!! he is the heart and soulf of the strategy for this year) ....federico was sold.... that changes the whole perception to them. and nobody centralized it. so center strategy is 03 dashboards - 1 pre-game / 2 during game / 3 after game - and around these a bunch of ideas to be implemented over time - to make the project doable. Im a megalomaniac - so if I dont hold my horses.... 

so to start small and right away, Im trying to map this pro gambler lifecycle - in between a game and the other (obivously different championships). One thing  I thought was to have a feed of news - about everything related to this championship - so the teams, players, technical staff, etc, etc - and create an astonishing design to each news. people overlook this. john hurted his knee today - is not just a piece of news. It changes the whole game. And they - pros - know it. So I want to give them interfaces that are not only beautiful - but focused on UX - creating the correct value to each thing. So a feed - imagine a Tinder where each person is a news. You stop, look, think... not like a small line in the middle on 1000 others - as it is today on any sports news sites - so he can consume really that. And I need ideas - that are not hard to code today - MVP - that will create an addiction for him to stay on this feed. All this content powered by AI bots I can create (as soon as you teach me lol!) - or any other AI automation you can let me know of. Do you get it??  AI scraping news + beautiful UI + UX that makes a lot of sense (specifically for their minds...which is pretty different believe me.. prima donnas...) + addictive ideas. My gut feeling is that they will say..."GOSH!!! finally someone that understands it!!". Today the very few that exist are inside betting companies - again focused on numbers - which to be honest, they dont care so much.. (soccer!!)... because they more or less already have (or think they have) all in their minds. 

monetization - initially i thought 3 tiers  - free  /pro - 30usd month  /master 250usd month ??? Not sure.. already thinking on simplifying it to start with only free and master lets say. inital name I thought - BELT - several reasons - we are you support - AI is changing everything - what are you going to bet on - the solution to keep you in front of the game.  Concept: The Game is Over. Breathe. Look me in the eyes and tell me: What brought you here?  - these guys are hardcore, they make millions. I want to create IMPACT. 

Cool! Now, ideas! Give me a roadmap. Give me a realistic strategy to start today. Small. Give me as detailed as possible. I dont know anything in depth about soccer betting in the US. give me a complete guide of all the sites i need to study, the 20 biggest in the US, similar ideas as mine, everything strategic you can think of!! I dont have a cent. Literally. But I have 30 years of Creative Direction and UX UI Desing. 5M+ done on Upwork, over 2000 projects. https://br.linkedin.com/in/danielrothier   ///   https://danielrothier.com/featured
 

I want to design the screens - which im really good at 0 and i need to code eveything with AI - and then register a free domain - plug in a payment solution (free) - and use - that can be my host - to have a minimum website up and running in a few days. give me the roadmap, AIs I can use, tools I can use,  I have some basic coding skills so I can understand a lot about concepts  - db, etc, etc - websites I can use, domains I can register for free, sources of information (free) to feed it, bots to create, the dashboards, and so don
